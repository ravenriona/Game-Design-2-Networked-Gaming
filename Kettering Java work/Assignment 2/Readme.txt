In my assignment I used Array List for my matches container. It was the first of the two API's that 
I looked at. It felt very intuitive, on top of it being very fast for searching large quantities of
data.


The delete player function does not work properly on the backend, but the frontend implementation is
functional.

When you open the assignment, please choose a file to import. There is one provided for you under the 
name Testfile.txt

"Insert player" will insert a player. The gui will prompt for the correct data types. 

"Insert match" will insert a match. The gui will prompt for the correct data types. 

"Save file" will export the database to a desired file, and will create a file for you if one did not
already exist.

"Reset" will reset the database.

"Import file" will import a file selected, and it demonstrated both at launch, and through the use of
the import button.
