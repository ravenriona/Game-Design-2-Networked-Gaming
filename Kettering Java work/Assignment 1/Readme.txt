Assignment 1

1.) Create a file with a list of players and matches with the following formats in all capital 
letters

Players: PLAYER/FED81/ROGER/FEDERER/1981/SWITZERLAND

Matches: MATCH/FED81/NAD86/20070308/WIMBLEDON/6-4,2-6,7-6


2.) Run this file by entering it into the command arguments, using the interface to navigate the 
program.

3.) There is a problem with calculating the win loss multiple times, I think I know what the problem is, 
but I cannot implement it correctly. I think this would hurt me to continue working on rather than 
turning in the project as is.
